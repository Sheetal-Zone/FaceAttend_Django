- ✅ Implemented movement verification algorithms
- ✅ Added confidence scoring and threshold management
- ✅ Created comprehensive error handling for AI model failures

## 🏗️ Architecture Changes

### Before (Static Image Upload)
```
Student Registration → Image Upload → Face Detection → Storage → Registration Complete
```

### After (Liveness Detection)
```
Student Registration → Liveness Session → Camera Feed → Movement Verification → 
Face Embedding Extraction → Anti-Spoofing Check → Registration Complete
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Liveness Detection Process
1. **Session Creation**: Generate unique session ID with expiration
2. **Frame Processing**: Capture and process frames for each position
3. **Face Detection**: Use YOLO v11 to detect faces in real-time
4. **Embedding Extraction**: Use ArcFace to extract face embeddings
