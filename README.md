## üéØ Usage

### Student Registration with Liveness Detection

1. **Access Student Registration**
   - Navigate to the student registration page
   - Fill in student details (name, roll number, etc.)

2. **Start Liveness Detection**
   - Click "Start Liveness Detection" button
   - Grant camera permissions when prompted

3. **Complete Liveness Verification**
   - **Step 1**: Face the camera directly (Center position)
   - **Step 2**: Slowly turn your head to the left
   - **Step 3**: Slowly turn your head to the right
   - Follow the on-screen instructions and progress indicators

4. **Registration Completion**
   - System verifies movement patterns
   - Face embeddings are extracted and stored
   - Student is registered with liveness verification

### Liveness Detection Process

The system uses advanced AI models to verify liveness:

1. **Face Detection**: YOLO v11 detects faces in real-time
2. **Movement Tracking**: Monitors head movements across three positions
3. **Embedding Extraction**: ArcFace extracts face embeddings for each position
4. **Liveness Verification**: Compares embeddings to detect natural movement patterns
5. **Anti-Spoofing**: Prevents static image and video-based attacks

### API Endpoints

#### Liveness Detection API
```bash
# Create liveness session
POST /api/v1/liveness/session

# Process frame for liveness detection
POST /api/v1/liveness/detect

# Verify liveness completion
POST /api/v1/liveness/verify

# Register student with liveness
POST /api/v1/liveness/register-student
```

#### Student Management API
```bash
# Get all students
GET /api/v1/students

# Create student
POST /api/v1/students

# Update student
PUT /api/v1/students/{id}

# Delete student
DELETE /api/v1/students/{id}
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:

```env
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./face_attendance.db

# AI Model Paths
YOLO_MODEL_PATH=models/yolov11n.pt
FACE_RECOGNITION_MODEL=arcface_r100_v1

# Security Settings
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here

   - Ensure camera is not in use by other applications
   - Try refreshing the page

2. **Liveness Detection Fails**
   - Ensure good lighting conditions
   - Follow movement instructions precisely
   - Check for multiple faces in frame
   - Ensure smooth head movements

3. **AI Models Not Loading**
   - Check model file paths in configuration
   - Ensure sufficient disk space
   - Verify GPU drivers (if using GPU acceleration)

### Debug Mode
